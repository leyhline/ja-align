# ja-align

This is a prototype I built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for aligning japanese audio and text using the [Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm) on katakana. For converting japanese kanji to katakana I also created a web build of [mecab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/) in another repository: [mecab-web-worker](https://github.com/leyhline/mecab-web-worker)

The result is hosted with GitHub Pages: https://leyhline.github.io/ja-align/

Here's also a small video for a short introduction, although I wouldn't recommand watching because I had a slight cold when I did the recording (and because of my accent, obviously).
